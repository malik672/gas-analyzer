# Gas Analyzer

## Overview

Gas Analyzer is a static analysis tool designed to optimize Solidity smart contracts by analyzing gas consumption patterns. Leveraging Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing and regular expressions, this tool identifies potential gas inefficiencies and provides insights into optimizing your Ethereum smart contracts.

## Features

- **Gas Inefficiency Detection**: Identify code patterns that may lead to higher gas consumption.
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Offer suggestions for optimizing gas usage in Solidity contracts.
- **AST Parsing**: Utilize Abstract Syntax Tree parsing for deeper analysis of contract structures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Solidity Compiler](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html) (for contract compilation)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the Gas Analyzer repository
git clone https://github.com/malik/gas-analyzer.git

# Change into the project directory
cd gas-analyzer

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Usage
- to change the contract code
- navigate to src
- rewrite the contract.sol file to your choice
- after run `cargo build` then `cargo run ` in your project terminal
```
